My first website built in the MVC design pattern.

I'm using https://github.com/WernervanderMerwe/The-Complete-Javascript-Course/tree/main/18-forkify/starter/src/js as a base to reference back to but it has proved way harder than I initially anticipated to try and recreate the MVC design using the website im building exposing quite a few weaknesses regarding understanding the "this" keyword, inheritance, OOP in general, functions calling functions on calling functions.

Using TailwindCSS to help me style the UI and bring on element changes quicker.

I used random 'E-store' Templates and added my own flair on what I think looks good.

Todo:
1) Look into hashchange to split the website up into pages.
2) Impliment a remove item in cart function
3) Do step 2-4 on https://developers.payfast.co.za/docs#home
4) make a Payment success modal message when redirected from Payfast
5) Add contact me dropdown
6) Refactor the TailwindCSS code to read easier and get rid of unnecessary Tailwind code not working anymore.
7) Refactor all my old logic so that it follows the same structure of the new understanding of how eventlisteners work.
8) Install Parcel, build, fix bugs and deploy to netlify.
