My first website built in the MVC design pattern.

I'm using https://github.com/WernervanderMerwe/The-Complete-Javascript-Course/tree/main/18-forkify/starter/src/js as a base to reference back to but it has proved way harder than I initially anticipated to try and recreate the MVC design using the website im building exposing quite a few weaknesses regarding understanding the "this" keyword, inheritance, OOP in general, functions calling functions on calling functions.

Using TailwindCSS to help me style the UI and bring on element changes quicker.

I used random 'E-store' Templates and added my own flair on what I think looks good.

Todo:
1) Look into hashchange to split the website up into pages.
2) Get all "buttons" to work and do something.

3) Impliment cost text and a grey backgroundcolor to the products in the category page and on "hover" change the opacity respectively. *done

4) Build a product page to tie in with PayFast API.
5) Refactor the TailwindCSS code to read easier and get rid of unnecessary Tailwind code not working anymore.
6) Make sure I follow the Do Not Repeat Yourself principle.
7) Install Parcel, build, fix bugs and deploy to netlify.
